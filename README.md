## Usage

The Todo List app allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks, mark tasks as complete, and reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality.

The app uses the useLocalStorage custom hook to store tasks in localStorage, so your tasks will persist even if you close the app or refresh the page.

The app also uses the react-beautiful-dnd library to implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.
